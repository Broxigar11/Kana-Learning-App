# Kana Learning App

Welcome to Kana Learning App! This application is designed to help you learn and practice both Hiragana and Katakana characters, the two fundamental Japanese writing systems.

## Features

- **Random Character Generation**: The app generates a random Hiragana or Katakana character for you to identify.
- **Input Field for Answering**: You can input your guess for the character's reading.
- **Feedback for Correctness**: If your answer is correct, the app generates another character. If not, it provides the correct reading and then generates another character.
- **Tracking of Correct and Incorrect Answers**: The app keeps count of your correct and incorrect answers.
- **Tab Toggle for Character Selection**: There are two tabs, one for Hiragana and one for Katakana, allowing you to choose which characters to practice.
- **Combined Hiragana and Katakana**: You can activate both tabs simultaneously to practice both Hiragana and Katakana characters randomly.
- **Weighted Random Algorithm**: The app utilizes a weighted random algorithm. If your answer is correct, it will halve the chance of getting the character again. If your answer is incorrect, it resets the probability to its starting state.

## How to Use

6. **Track Your Progress**: Keep an eye on the count of correct and incorrect answers to monitor your progress.
